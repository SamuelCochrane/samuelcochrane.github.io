# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm an intelligence developer. Whether that's ETL'ing the data itself it make it useable, or working directly with the client to design a beautiful and functional window into their business - I'm there.

Right now, I'm working on:
- Building new & outstanding PowerBI/PowerApps work for my stakeholders within a Fortune-5 company. :bar_chart:
- Refining my latest Android app: a quantified-self project for tracking your energy levels. :iphone:

Always seeking an opportunity to make things better. Let's connect. :smile:
