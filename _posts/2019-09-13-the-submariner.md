"The Source-Code of Intrinsic Motivation"

getting into a state of mostly Alpha (some Theta) brainwave activity

Technical term for flow: **Transient Hypo-Frontality**

_Transient_: Temporary
_Hypo_: Less-active
_Frontality_: Front-part of brain relating to Ego, long-term planning

This is why time-dilation (time passing faster in Flow) happens, time-sense is calculated in the prefrontal cortex.

- Anxiety shuts down, stress chemicals leave the brain.
- Sense of self disappears (including the 'inner critic')
- Risk taking goes up & shame/self-censoring goes down, which causes creativity goes up

Three key areas are impacted (positively):
- Motivation
- Creativity (Taking in new & novel information, connecting it to old ideas, and using those new connections to create something new)
- Learning (Take in more info per second, pattern-recognition goes up, lateral-thinking (outsidethebox) goes up)

Difficulty of task should be 4% above your actual skill level (an overcomeable challenge)

Flow follows focus


Decide what you need the flow for (to accomplish what)
Determine why the outcome is important to you (why it's important)
Visualize being in flow (focus, 4%)
Establish a distraction-free workzone (mute notifications, clear off desk [meez])
Put on Focus-Music (binurial, isochronic)

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
