Question: Given the aroma/bitterness/etc of a cup of coffee, can we predict if it will be a 'good' cup of coffee as rated by professional coffee tasters?

Check out the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/SamuelCochrane/CoffeeML/blob/master/CoffeeML.ipynb) to follow along.

We'll bring in the data, do preliminary exploration, transform it for analysis, separate it into training/test sets, determine which model results in the highest accuracy predictions, and predict the rating a new cup of coffee might receive.


Info from [The Coffee Institute](https://coffeeinstitute.org), data scraped by [James LeDoux](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database).

Let's start with our initial imports. This will bring in everything we'll need for the project, including ways to manipulate data (pandas), visualize data (matplotlib), and do ML analysis (sklearn)
```
##data tools
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
##ML tools
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
%matplotlib inline
```

Now let's get and take a quick look at our data
```
#get the data
coffeeRaw = pd.read_csv('arabica_data_cleaned.csv')
#display some of the data
coffeeRaw.head()
>>>
```
