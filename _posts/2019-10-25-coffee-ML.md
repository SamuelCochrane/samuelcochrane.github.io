Question: Given the aroma/bitterness/etc of a cup of coffee, can we predict if it will be a 'good' cup of coffee as rated by professional coffee tasters?

Check out the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/SamuelCochrane/CoffeeML/blob/master/CoffeeML.ipynb) to follow along.

We'll bring in the data, do preliminary exploration, transform it for analysis, separate it into training/test sets, determine which model results in the highest accuracy predictions, and predict the rating a new cup of coffee might receive.
