Our goal: Create a gym log in excel that takes care of as much automatically as possible.

# The Problem

A routine we grab from the internet might look something like this:

|Day 1|
|Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|---|---|---|
|Bench Press |3 | 8
|Cable Crossover |3 | 8
|PZ||

|Day 2|
|Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|---|---|---|
|Bench Press |3 | 8
|Cable Crossover |3 | 8
|PZ||

This gives us a lot of things to track every day by ourselves.
- What weight week-to-week?
- When do we progress?
- What muscles are we working with each exercise?

Ideally, we would have a system to track these things for us, instead of writing it all out in a journal each week.

Let's build a system that takes care of the heavy lifting (har har).

- Let us type in the rep scheme in short form (145lb 3x8) and automatically build out a long version (145x8 145x8 145x8).

# Initial Setup

We'll want a place we can enter our routine in short form that all the other days can reference later. This doesn't represent a day of exercise in itself, but rather the _template_ for a day of exercise.

This gives us an input field for:
- day of exercise
- focus for that day
- up to ten exercises
  - starting weight for each
  - sets (up to 5) for each
  - reps for each
  - Rate of Percieved Exertion (RPE, how hard it was from 1-10)
  - Lifting Tempo (how many seconds up/down)
- Warmup
- Cooldown
- Cardio Circuit

We can create one of these for each day of exercise.

##Bonus Feature: Exercise Dropdown

Let's say we get bored easily and want to quickly swap out similar exercises, like swapping out a dumbbell fly for a cable fly.
