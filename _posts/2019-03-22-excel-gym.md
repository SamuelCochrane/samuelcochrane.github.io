> Before we get


Our goal: Create a gym log in excel that takes care of as much automatically as possible.

# The Problem

A routine we grab from the internet might look something like this:

|Day 1|
|Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|---|---|---|
|Bench Press |3 | 8
|Cable Crossover |3 | 8
|PZ||

|Day 2|
|Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|---|---|---|
|Bench Press |3 | 8
|Cable Crossover |3 | 8
|PZ||

This gives us a lot of things to keep track of every day by ourselves.
- What weight am I doing this week? What weight did I do last week?
- When do I progress?
- What muscles are we working with each exercise?

Ideally, we would have a system to track these things for us, instead of writing it all out in a journal each week.

Let's build a system that takes care of the heavy lifting for us[^pun].

One limitation: We won't be using any VBA. While VBA scripts can add an insane level of functionality to Excel, they don't work on the mobile client, and we need something that will work when we use it during our workout.

# Initial Setup

We'll want a place we can enter our routine in short form that all the other days can reference later. This doesn't represent a day of exercise in itself, but rather the _template_ for a day of exercise.

<figcaption>Each yellow box represents an input field. </figcaption>
</figure>

Here I've built out an area gives us an input field for:
- day of exercise (e.g. Monday)
- focus for that day (e.g. Back & Biceps)
- up to ten exercises
  - starting weight for each (this will increase week-to-week)
  - sets (up to 5) for each
  - goal reps for each
  - Rate of Perceived Exertion ('RPE', how hard it was from 1-10)
  - Lifting Tempo (how many seconds up/down)
- Warmup
- Cooldown
- Cardio Circuit

We can create one of these for each day of exercise per week.
(e.g. three boxes if we go 3x/week)

## Bonus Feature: Exercise Dropdown

Let's say we get bored easily and want to quickly swap out similar exercises, like swapping out a dumbbell fly for a cable fly. We can create an 'exercise database' of sorts on a new tab to make that easier for ourselves.

In each area we'll put a title for that type of exercise, and a list of however many alternatives we want to present.

<img src="../assets/images/Annotation 2019-07-21 114003.png">


Then, we'll make each of these boxes a named range. We can do this by selecting the box and typing our desired name into the finder bar in the top left.

Now, go back to one of your day templates and select an exercise, then type in "data validation" in the query bar at the top of Excel.

</figure>



In the popup window, we'll set the source equal to that named range we just made.

Boom! Now this cell will have a dropdown option that lets you quickly select any of the alternative exercises we defined earlier.

This process can be repeated to give ourselves similar dropdowns for Tempo and RPE.

- Let us type in the rep scheme in short form (145lb 3x8) and automatically build out a long version (145x8 145x8 145x8).
<hr>

##Initial Buildout: A day of exercise.

Now that we have our templates for what each type of day should look like, we'll need something to track the actual days of exercise themselves.

What we have: "Every Thursday, do Bench Press 3x5 at 135lbs"
What we need: "Today, I did 5 5 and 4 at 135lbs"

In other words, this should let us type in the rep scheme in short form ("145LBs 3x8") and automatically build out a long version (145x8 145x8 145x8).
