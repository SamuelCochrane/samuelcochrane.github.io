The following is my personal take on how to make and break habits. It's inspired heavily by James Clear's [Atomic Habits](AmazonLinkPZ.com) and Charles Duhigs PZ.

# What is a habit?

# The Habit Loop
Cue -> Desire -> Action -> Reward

PZ a habit is something you stop thinking about quote

Each habit

What we usually think of as the habit is only the Action of the habit, but it's important to look at the habit in the larger context. We need to know why (Desire/Reward) and when (Cue) we do the habit before we can start to make changes to it.

Let's look at the life cycle of a few common positive habits.

| Habit     | Cue     | Desire    | Action      | Reward      |
|---        |---      |---        |---          |---          |
|Brushing your teeth | It's bedtime and your mouth doesn't feel minty fresh. | Make the mouth feel minty fresh. | Brushing your teeth. | Minty freshness.
|
This model holds true for bad habits as well. Everything we do we do for a reason, and no matter how much we verbally berate ourselves for a bad habit, there's always something we're getting out of it that tips the scales towards repeated behavior.[^shortterm]

[^shortterm]: Often what we think of as a bad habit is an action that trades short-term pleasure for long-term pain. Smoking, procrastinating, snoozing, etc. all fit this description.

| Habit     | Cue     | Desire    | Action      | Reward      |
|---        |---      |---        |---          |---          |
|Hitting Snooze | Alarm goes off and I still feel tired. | Go back to sleep. | Hitting snooze. | More sleep.
|Binging on snack food | I'm hungry and tired. | Eat something. | Eating an entire tray of Oreo's[^vegan] in one sitting. | A full stomach, a sugar rush, and some satisfied taste buds.

[^vegan]: Fun-Fact: Oreo's are so artificial that they're technically vegan.

# The Four Rules of Habit Creation
When forming new habits.
## Make it Obvious
Make the cue visible and clearly defined.

For every habit you have or are trying to make, you should be able to answer the sentence: "When I `[Cue]`, I will `[Action]`".

"When I `[Get to work]`, I will `[Grab some coffee and a donut from the breakroom].`"
"When I `[Feel stressed or bored at my computer]`, I will `[Open Instagram on my phone].`"

The trick then becomes to make the Cues and required items for the desired actions more visible.

For instance, we could leave some healthy breakfast bars in the breakroom at work to transform our donut habit to:
"When I `[Get to work]`, I will `[Grab some coffee and a breakfast-bar from the breakroom].`"
Or leave a fidget cube on our desk and keep our phone in our backpack to change our Instagram habit to:
"When I `[Feel stressed or bored at my computer]`, I will `[Play with the fidget cube until the stress goes away].`"


## Make it Attractive
Any solid habit must in some capacity, at least in the moment, feel like a *good choice*. It must play into some desire or lack we're currently experiencing. *I'm hungry, I'm sleepy, I'm bored, I'm stressed*. These common cues quickly find habits to fill these desires in some capacity. The habitual smartphone procrastinator does so because it helps them relieve stress. Every habit must ***serve a purpose.***

Instagram makes me less bored.
Oreo's make me less hungry.
Cigarettes make me less stressed.

The trick is to find a way to make the good habits as desirable as possible.

A few common tricks include:
- Temptation bundling. Pair an action you *want* to do with an action you *need* to do.
- Stakes & Rewards.

## Make it Easy


Social media can become an automatic response so easily because it is often so accessible.

If our goal is to start going to the gym more regularly, we can do a number of things to make that easier.
  - Leave a packed gym bag in our car so can go straight from work to the gym without having to stop at home first.
  - Join a gym that's close to work to avoid longer commute times.

## Make it Satisfying
# Reversal: the Four Rules of Habit Destruction
## Make it Invisible
## Make it Ugly
## Make it Hard

A social media addict could give their phone to a coworker to store in their desk during work. The added friction of having to ask someone to retrieve your phone is often enough to make sure you only grab it for legitimate reasons.

## Make it Unsatisfying

Phone addicts can switch their display to Grayscale.
