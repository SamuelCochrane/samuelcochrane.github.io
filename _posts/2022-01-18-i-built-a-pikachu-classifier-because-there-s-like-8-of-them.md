Creating over a thousand distinct creatures is pretty hard, right? I've always said that. At some point, it's pretty understandable that GameFreak would have some repeated archetypes over 20yrs.

And for some reason, _Electric Rodent_ is #1.

Depending on who you ask, there are upwards of a dozen entirely seperate 'mons that fit into the [Pikachu Family](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pikachu-family_Pok%C3%A9mon "Pikachu Family"), a fan term for the litany  of all-too-similar-looking mice, rats, squirrels, hedgehogs, and gerbils that (adorably) infest the Pokémon world.

Of course, this presents a distinct challenge for anyone who doesn't want to take take a college course on poké-taxonomy and just wants to know _which_ 'mon they saw a cute plushie for at Target.

Too that end, {{page.title}}
