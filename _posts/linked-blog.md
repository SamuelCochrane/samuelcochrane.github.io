# [[linked-blog]]

 A [[Digital Garden]] framework created by the founder of Fleeting Notes, and the core of the stack used to run this website. 

  > [GitHub - matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter: Host your second brain for free with Next.JS and Tailwind v3](https://github.com/matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter)

## Features

 - uses [[next.js]] (vs jekyll/hugo)
 - deploys on [[vercel]]
 - from a proven dev (creator of Fleeting Notes)
 - looks nice :) (vs quartz/others)
 - separate repos for the pure content (.md) and for the site
- Converts ObsidianMD to HTML
	-   [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export)¬†(Obsidian MD ->¬†[Common MD](https://commonmark.org/))
	-   [remarkjs](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)¬†(Common MD -> HTML)
	-   [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)¬†(HTML -> Beautiful HTML)

## Publishing Process

How this website is updated:
1. Tag content in my [[Obsidian|obsidian.md]] vault I want to publish with the frontmatter `share: true` in .
	1. Linter adds relevant frontmatter like title, dateCreated, dateModified
2. Run the Obsidian Publish plugin to push the selected notes to my github markdown-only repo [SamuelCochrane/linked-blog-md](https://github.com/SamuelCochrane/linked-blog-md).
	1. plugin uses regex to remove the markdown `#title` from the note (as it will be handled by the `title` frontmatter when published)
3. this triggers a GitHub Action which grabs the website source code from my site-only repo [SamuelCochrane/linked-blog-website](https://github.com/SamuelCochrane/linked-blog-website) and stitches it together with the updated markdown files, deploying via [[vercel]].
4. The site is hosted on Vercel.

## Forking This Site

If you want to use this as the base, this site is open source and linked above. It is provided as-is, and it would be bold to assume even _I_ remember how it works.
This blog wouldn't have been possible without Matthew Wong's starter code. All credit goes to him, all bugs are from me.

Some specific things you'll probably want to change:
- The blog title, currently lives in header.tsx
- The frontmatter variables like `dateCreated` if you named things differently in your own vault
	- (These will mostly be in /components/, post.ts, and api.ts, but I'd use a Ctrl+H over the entire project to find any instances just in case)
- the favicon
- The text in the landing page (landing/hero-home.tsx)

The domain was purchased from Google Domains, and represents my only ongoing expense hosting this website.
