<p>Freeter (フリーター furītā) is a Japanese term for young individuals (18-35) who pursue only temp jobs, part-time jobs, or are jobless, and describes a unique subculture that exists in Japan of people who intentionally stray away from the traditional career paths of ‘salary men’.</p>

<p>I finished my B.S. in Informatics while abroad, and completed an anthropological analysis of this subculture as a final project.</p>
